# qlcog — quantum-like models of cognition and decision

`qlcog` is a Python package of **quantum-like (quantum-probability) models** of human judgement and
decision, each paired with the **classical models it must beat**, a common fitting and comparison
interface, and **Qiskit circuits** that run the same models on simulators and on IBM Quantum or Amazon
Braket hardware. It is domain-agnostic: the same models apply to surveys, finance, medicine, consumer
research, human–computer interaction, AI evaluation and robotics.

> Quantum-like models use the mathematics of quantum probability (vectors, projections, interference)
> to describe judgements. They run on ordinary computers and make no claim that the brain is a quantum
> computer. The circuits are an optional second way to execute them.

## Installation

```bash
cd github/qlcog
pip install -e .                 # core: numpy, scipy
pip install -e ".[qiskit]"       # + Qiskit and Aer (circuits, local simulation, IBM fake-backend noise)
pip install -e ".[cloud]"        # + IBM Qiskit Runtime and Amazon Braket SDK (hardware)
pip install -e ".[all,dev]"      # everything + pytest
```

Python 3.10 or later. The examples and tests also run without installing (they add `src/` to the path).

## Quick start

```python
import numpy as np
from qlcog.core import compare
from qlcog.families.order_effects import QuantumOrderModel4D, BayesOrderModel, AnchoringOrderModel, qq_test

counts = {'AB': np.array([212, 48, 61, 179]),   # A asked first: yes-yes, yes-no, no-yes, no-no
          'BA': np.array([240, 33, 52, 175])}   # B asked first
print(qq_test(counts))                           # (q, z, p)
for r in compare([QuantumOrderModel4D, BayesOrderModel, AnchoringOrderModel], counts):
    print(type(r.model).__name__, round(r.bic, 1), r.model.params)
```

Run the same model as a circuit:

```python
from qlcog.circuits import order_effects_circuit, run
from qlcog.core import tvd
model = QuantumOrderModel4D(t1=0.7, t2=1.0, t3=0.6, phi=0.4)
qc, decode = order_effects_circuit(model, 'AB', form='dynamic')
cells = decode(run(qc, 'aer:FakeTorino', shots=8000))     # IBM Heron noise model
print(cells, tvd(cells, model.predict()['AB']))
```

## Design of the package

```
src/qlcog/
  core/        linalg.py   projectors, Lueders rule, sequences, density matrices, Lindblad
               model.py    Model base class and Param (kinds: prob, angle, real, positive, bounded)
               fit.py      fit, compare (AIC/BIC), recovery (model-recovery study), kl, tvd
  families/    one subpackage per family: models.py, __init__.py, README.md
  circuits/    builders.py (circuits + decoders), backends.py (run on Aer, IBM, Braket)
  data/        published aggregate data sets
examples/      eleven domain examples
tests/         unit tests for core, families and circuits
```

Every model follows one interface:

| Member | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PARAMS` | list of `Param(name, kind, default, lo, hi)`; kinds map to an unconstrained vector for fitting |
| `LOSS` | `'multinomial'` (counts) or `'sse'` (mean judgements) |
| `predict(design)` | dict condition → probability vector (or predicted values) |
| `loglik(data, design)`, `sse(data, design)`, `sample(design, n, rng)` | likelihood, squared error, simulation |
| options (keyword arguments that are not parameters) | structural choices, e.g. projector ranks or a Bayesian network |

`fit(Model, data, design, restarts, structures=[...])` searches discrete structures (e.g. projector
ranks) as well as continuous parameters; `compare` ranks models by BIC or AIC; `recovery` runs a
model-recovery study before data collection, which shows how many observations are needed to tell the
models apart.

## Running on quantum hardware

```bash
python3 examples/11_cloud_run.py --dry-run                                  # local, no account
python3 examples/11_cloud_run.py --backend ibm:least_busy --shots 4000      # IBM Quantum
python3 examples/11_cloud_run.py --backend braket:arn:aws:braket:us-east-1::device/qpu/ionq/Forte-1 --shots 1000
```

`run(circuit, backend)` accepts `aer`, `aer:<FakeBackend>`, `braket_local`, `braket_dm:<p>`,
`ibm:<device>` and `braket:<ARN>`. Braket backends need the deferred-measurement form (no mid-circuit
reset). Hardware runs cost queue time or money; report their results exactly as measured, with backend,
date and job identifier.

## Choosing a model

1. **Check the phenomenon first.** Is there an order effect (rates change with position)? A violation
   of the law of total probability? Asymmetric similarity? If not, a classical model is enough.
2. **Fit the quantum-like model and its classical baselines together** with `compare`, and prefer the
   model with the lower BIC; report all of them.
3. **Use the distinctive test** of each family (QQ equality, total-probability bounds, the
   Contextuality-by-Default criterion, the effect of an intermediate judgement), not only goodness of fit.
4. **Run a recovery study** (`qlcog.core.recovery`) with your planned sample size before collecting
   data.
5. **Beware saturation:** a model with as many parameters as data points (e.g. the interference model on
   three proportions) can represent an effect without predicting it.

## Data

`qlcog.data` contains the only human data in the package, all published aggregates:
the Clinton–Gore order effect (Moore, 2002), the Prisoner's Dilemma disjunction effect (Shafir and
Tversky, 1992), the two-stage gamble (Tversky and Shafir, 1992) and the Linda problem rate (Tversky and
Kahneman, 1983). Every other data set in the examples is simulated and labelled as such.

## Testing

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q tests        # 18 tests: core, all eight families, circuits on Aer and Braket
```

The circuit tests check every builder against its analytic model (statevector-exact for the
post-selection circuits).

## Limitations

- Fitting aggregate counts assumes a homogeneous population; individual differences can hide or mimic
  quantum-like structure.
- Several quantum-like models have been challenged by further tests (Grand Reciprocity equations for
  order effects; conjunction-fallacy tests; response replicability); the family READMEs list these.
- Circuits reproduce the analytic models on simulators; current hardware noise distorts them
  (total-variation error of a few percent for small circuits). No hardware results ship with the package.
